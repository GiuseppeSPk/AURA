For one, the middle 20% of taxpayers are not the middle class - the \"middle class\" comprises as much as 2/3 of the population in countries like Australia. The Economist defines middle class \"as having a reasonable amount of discretionary income, so that they do not live from hand to mouth as the poor do, and defined it as beginning at the point where people have roughly a third of their income left for discretionary spending after paying for basic food and shelter.\" This means you can have a country of the ultra rich 1% and 99% poor and no middle class, and the middle 20% of taxpayers are still all poor.\n\nTwo, you can cut taxes without cutting them for the rich - you lower the rate in the bottom brackets, benefiting the poor and middle class, and raise the bracket on the rich to compensate. Done.\n\nI do think it's perverse that some people are getting paid by the IRS though, that's one step too far in my book.",

If you are black and ignore that, you will never have peace, a job, or you freedom. The truth is that as a nation we have not made peace with our racist heritage. Being polite became \"political correctness\" when us \"others\" demanded the same rights and freedoms that white males have. For example, the 2nd Amendment is a white privilege.

Its intent is to sow seeds of doubt in the targets, hoping to make them question their own memory, perception, and sanity.\n\nIf you follow Mr (soon to be President) Trump's comments and tweets, you will understand Mr. Rosemeyer's use of the term in reference to him.  From a \"reality \"TV\" star it was expected, from candidate Trump it was, first, amusing, then increasingly concerning; from the soon-to-be President, it's simply frightening.  Yes, that's my OPINION.  If you think his ever-changing tweets and denial of reality are OK, please explain why.....it might make me feel better.  Thanks, Gary \n‎",

And in that time, people will most certainly die. When a nut case like Assad starts gassing his people, I'm pretty sure the parents in those cities aren't gonna sit there, comfortably knowing that peace is coming, and the lives of their children have become the means to that end. They deserve action now, to give their kids a chance to live and see that peace.  \n\nIt's easy to be against something (say bombing) in favor of a greater good.

If not, there can be no expectation of reciprocity.  Alternatively, if a woman in the American contingent CHOSE to wear a head covering, I don't think I'd have any sort of huge problem with that either.  The choice to show respect should likewise be respected.  What would be very, very impressive to me, is if the American men donned traditionally female Saudi head dresses and walked the mile in others' shoes.

Now why would a mayor who professes fidelity with the taxpayers change the law to enable him to take more money from them? Probably because he plans to take more money from them.  Berkowitz said if Proposition 8 passes “it severely constrains our ability to give out property tax relief.”  So Berkowitz wants the ability to confiscate more of the citizen’s money to provide property relief. How about taking less of that money in the first place?  Let’s hope Proposition 8 passes.",

Most of these talks really aren't about the gee-whiz aspects of technology so much as how to allow tech to enhance the human experience -- or how to not allow what is essentially human to get overwhelmed by the rapid advances in tech.\n\nFrancis isn't saying anything new or radical here, but it's good stuff that's worth reiterating.

The ratification process was no slam dunk for the supporters of the Constitution, it almost failed.  Supporters of the Constitution were known as Federalists, non-supporters as Anti-Federalists.  Thanks to the anti-Federalists we had the first 10 amendments to the Constitution known as the Bill of Rights in 1791.  But, those first amendments actually started out as 12.  One of those 12 became part of the Constitution on 5 May 1992, as the 27th Amendment and believe it or not, one amendment is still pending before the states.",

No lie: 50 and 60 below and never got cold once. I put thick wool felt insoles in the mukluks and wore thinner mittens inside the moose-mitts and that did the trick. Hey, it worked for the Ahtna people for thousands of years. And if you want to keep your toes warm indoors all winter get a pair of moosehide moccasin slippers.

Indeed, when there were only midwives, abortion was not illegal, regardless of what the Church thought of it, and the Catholic Church had no say in the Federal period.  The 14th Amendment specifies birth or naturalization for citizenship, although born aliens have due process rights as well. In Chapter X, the Court recognized the rights of those who could be born as if they were, with notable exceptions that are very rare. No one just has an abortion because they change their minds about parenthood in the third trimester.\n\nGonzalez v. Carhart extended jurisdiction to Congress in cases of  partial birth abortion, operating under the Commerce Clause.  It would have been better had they cited the 14th Amendment provisions allowing Congress to enforce the 14th Amendment, which would include expanding personhood to earlier in pregnancy.

The current route puts many people in great danger, even though KM have altered over 50% of the route to improve it. When it was initially built over 60 years ago, that region wasn't very populated  and there was only the occasional oil tanker travelling through the harbour.\n My suggestion is why doesn't the pipeline stay on the south side of the Fraser River, then go on the flat delta land to the Roberts Bank docks?  I was very pleased when I was told by a KM person at an open house, they also felt that route was best, but they said it would be much more difficult than just expanding the current route. Even the premier of AB suggested that route a few years ago.\n So the pipeline will go in the wrong location because it is an easier procedure !\nTo PG-2:",

I am speaking here, now, of those who commit suicide, not those who kill from lack of respect for human life. A mother whose child was killed was asked if she could forgive the person who killed her child. She said that judging him was not her burden. That it was God's burden to bear. Someone chose to pull the trigger. They will be responsible for that before God.  But our job is to try to see as God sees, with Mercy rather than judgment. We enter into the mystery of being human.

By 1997-98, the federal government recorded its first annual surplus in 28 years, and (as of 2007) has continued to post large surpluses every year. Moreover, the Chrétien government used these annual surpluses to lower the national debt.

One is that it is quite possible he did not throw the grenade that killed the American soldier; his wounds when he was found were severe, he was under a pile of rubble and he was unarmed.  The other is that if as a 15 year old he killed someone in a fight in Canada, he would be treated as a young offender and would have served far less time than he has.  At the same time, Dallaire is quite right to point out that he was controlled by a manipulative and abusive father.  It isn't realistic to think that given the environment he was in -- surrounded by Al Queada fighters -- that getting out of the situation was remotely possible.\nHe's never had anything like a fair trial; it is time for those who unload such vitriol at him to stop reacting emotionally and look at the facts of the case.",

That's why it has to go through a repair process.\n\nBut, once again, the good ASPIRATION (and there is simply ZERO legitimate argument that the aspiration is good) is undermined by the conservative greediness (for power and money).  So, the issue has become, somehow, how to undermine the aspirational good(s).\n\nSo, we agree on some things.  But, what we agree on, in my mind, simply cannot be served by the ultra right-wing conservative agenda, approach, or dogma.   Only bipartisanship.\n\nFor that reason, the conservatives, in my mind, must be knocked back substantially.  Otherwise, no hope of progress anywhere.\n\nWhat's happening with attempts to repeal Obamacare are merely a symptom of a much larger problem afflicting the GOP.",

It would be difficult (especially for a Christian), and probably counterproductive, to try to convince the justices that practicing his religion entails a broad refusal to serve a certain group.  Refer back to my original post...It's a much more tenable argument to say that certain SPECIFIC services require an extraordinary level of personal involvement in an event, beyond that of simply vendor of common goods or services. In this case the event is one he sees as a mockery of one of his religion's sacred rites. Thus, forcing him to be a participant violates his ability to practice his religion. He could reasonably claim the same if asked to make a wedding cake for a \"black mass\" wedding for heterosexual Satanists.\n\nTrying to include the freedom of speech issue would just muddy the waters and endanger success at this point, I think.",

During the primaries you and I had a discussion about Hillary Clinton's obligation to the women who accused her husband.  In fact, you thought it would have been a good idea if she had invited them to the White House for tea.  I'm curious, do you have the same expectations of Melania Trump? Is she responsible for her husband's infidelities and lewdness?  Should she have a sit-down with her husbands victims?  White House or Mar-a-Lago?",
